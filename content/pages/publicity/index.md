### Review Copy Requests

If you are a journalist or journal interested in a copy of a book for review, we can supply gratis copies of titles published within the past two years. 

Please include the following in your email:

* Name of book and author
* Your media outlet
* Full contact information (name, mailing address), along with any deadlines
* Links to your outlet's website

Review copy requests can take up to four weeks to process. Due to the volume of requests, we are unable to provide status updates. Upon publication, please send PDFs and/or links to coverage to [uvapressintern@gmail.com](mailto:uvapressintern@gmail.com "mailto\:uvapressintern@gmail.com").
