**Please note:**

* We are able to supply gratis review copies only for books published within the last two years.
* Review copy requests may take up to 4 weeks to process. If you are working under a deadline, please provide that information.
* Due to the high volume of requests we receive, we are often unable to provide updates on the status of review copy requests.
