Because a culture of equity and respect is vital to our publishing mission, the University of Virginia Press embraces a code of conduct that governs all of our collaborations, including staff, authors, reviewers, advisory boards, media, vendors, and other partners. The Press actively sustains a positive environment defined by constructive relationships, equity and inclusion, and mutual respect. We commit to holding challenging discussions of differences in a courteous, nonconfrontational manner and with respect to a diversity of viewpoints. The Press has zero tolerance for racism, sexism, homophobia, transphobia, ableism, ageism, or any other form of discrimination or harassment, or for unethical professional conduct of any kind.

If you have encountered a violation of the code of conduct outlined above, please [contact](mailto:eab7fb@virginia.edu) the Director of the Press at to discuss the matter. Incidents of discrimination, harassment, and other forms of abuse can also be reported to the [University of Virginiaâ€™s Office for Equal Opportunity and Civil Rights](https://eocr.virginia.edu/).
