#### Full-Time Positions at UVaP

There currently are no full-time opportunities at the Press.

#### UVaP Internship Program

The University of Virginia Press seeks volunteer interns on an ongoing basis. These unpaid internships are a wonderful chance to gain valuable job experience and an understanding of the field of scholarly publishing. Past interns have gone on to successful careers in both scholarly and trade publishing. Opportunities are available in Marketing and Publicity. Duties vary by department.

We ask for a time commitment of ten hours a week and prefer that interns stay at the Press for two semesters, though shorter internships are occasionally possible. Graduate and undergraduate students from all areas of the humanities and social sciences are encouraged to apply.

If you would like to find out more about our internship program please send your resume to Emma Donovan atÂ [efd4s@virginia.edu](mailto:efd4s@virginia.edu).
