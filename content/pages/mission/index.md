The University of Virginia Press is the scholarly publishing division of the University of Virginia.  The Press supports the academic mission of the University by publishing scholarship in a variety of print and digital formats that contributes to the progress of research and learning. We also actively seek works by scholars aimed at bringing the findings of a discipline to the well-educated reading public. Also important to our mission as part of a public university is the publication of works of regional interest to inform and engage the citizens of Virginia through guides to regional history, natural history, architecture, and culture. We seek to publish works of the highest quality that will bring positive recognition to the Press and the University.
