Founded in 1963, UVA Press has published almost 2,000 books in history, the humanities, architecture and design, culture, and on ideas and places important to Virginians. Our ground-breaking digital imprint, Rotunda, extends the reach of scholarship across the world through primary sources available to students, faculty, and scholars. UVA Press seeks new voices, illuminates new perspectives, and fuels aspirations for our shared world. Through our mission as a scholarly press, we strive to provoke new and inclusive thinking that improves the human condition.

The University of Virginia Press appreciates the support of individuals, organizations, and foundations. Please join us in this important work.
