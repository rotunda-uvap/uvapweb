Rivanna Books, the University of Virginia’s regional imprint, highlights Virginia history, art, folklore, nature and the environment, music, architecture, cuisine, and other subjects of general interest for readers throughout the commonwealth. UVA Press has a distinguished history of publishing cornerstone books on Virginia themes, and now Rivanna formally represents the press’s commitment to bringing the commonwealth’s history and culture to a wide audience, within and beyond the state. Named for the river that begins near Charlottesville in Albemarle County, flowing past Monticello and the original Monacan settlements before joining the James to reach the Chesapeake Bay and the Atlantic, Rivanna books follow a distinctly Virginian path to share our stories with the larger world.
