Published this week in UKSG Insights, "Towards inclusive scholarly publishing: developments in the university press community," coauthored by Niccole Leilanionapae‘aina Coggins, UVA Press Editorial, Design, and Production Coordinator and Assistant Project Editor, provides an overview of the ways in which the members of the Association of University Presses are working towards more inclusive practices in scholarly publishing. 

Coggins, along with coauthors Gisela Concepción Fosado of [Duke University Press,](https://www.dukeupress.edu/) Christie Henry of [Princeton University Press,](https://press.princeton.edu/) and Gita Manaktala of [MIT Press,](https://mitpress.mit.edu/) provide an overview of recent steps taken by AUPresses to explore and advance our core value of diversity, with a goal of empowering inclusion, equity and, ultimately, justice. They consider the Mellon Diversity Fellowship Program, the contributions of many dedicated volunteers in the Association’s task forces and committees as well as in press-based working groups, and several "Toolkits for Equity" that are currently in development.

"Armed with baseline information and critique as well as with continuing vigilance," they conclude, "we as leaders and colleagues can understand the scope of the problem and move to creatively disrupt the individual, structural and organizational barriers to equitable decision-making, power-sharing and community-building. We believe that this necessary work will contribute not only to our individual lives, workplaces and publications, but also to the network of stakeholders – the global knowledge ecosystem – that we as university presses serve."
