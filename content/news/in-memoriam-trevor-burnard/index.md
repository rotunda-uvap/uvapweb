The University of Virginia Press and the editors of [The Revolutionary Age](https://www.upress.virginia.edu/series/RA/) book series are saddened by the death of our beloved friend and colleague Trevor Burnard.  A prolific historian of the British Atlantic, with a specialization in the history of Jamaica and the Caribbean, Professor Burnard was one of the most distinguished scholars of his generation.  Among his many books was *[Writing Early America: From Empire to Revolution](https://upress.virginia.edu/title/5933/)*, which we were proud to publish in our series in 2023. It is an [open-access publication](https://open.upress.virginia.edu/projects/writing-early-america), for the benefit of established and emerging scholars in the field and all readers interested in the latest trends in history writing on the Early American period. 

Our condolences go out to Trevorâ€™s wife Deborah Morgan and their children Nicholas and Eleanor, and to his family in New Zealand.  Trevor will be missed by all whose lives he enriched.

Allow us to direct your attention to these two moving tributes of his life and achievements:
