It is with great sadness that we announce the passing of Reverend Nancy Claire Essig, former Director of the University of Virginia Press. Most recently having served as the Minister at the Burkeville Presbyterian Church in Virginia, Essig had a long career in scholarly publishing starting in New York City and moving to Johns Hopkins University Press before retiring as Director of UVA Press in 2001.

Essig had a special interest in both women's studies and aging studies—she started the Feminist Issues series and the Age Studies series at UVA Press—as well as acquiring books by the Virginia author and Pulitzer Prize winner Ellen Glasgow. She expanded the Press’s publishing profile beyond its University perimeters to respond to the growing calls for equity and diversity as well as concern for our environment.

Essig also worked with UVA Librarian John Unsworth on the first grant to establish the Press’s electronic imprint, now Rotunda. She was responsible for the physical expansion of Press offices at Bemiss House to accommodate a growing staff.
