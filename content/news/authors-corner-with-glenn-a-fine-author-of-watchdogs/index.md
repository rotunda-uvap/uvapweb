Today, we are happy to bring you our conversation with Glenn A. Fine, author of *Watchdogs: Inspectors General and the Battle for Honest and Accountable Government*

*What inspired you to write this book?* 

Inspectors general have an essential role in promoting  accountability, transparency, and honesty in government. I wrote this book to explain why inspectors general, who are a critical pillar of our democracy, need to be supported and strengthened. 

*What did you learn and what are you hoping readers will learn from your book?* 

In researching this book, I learned more about an inspector general who was instrumental to the birth of the United States. At the beginning of the Revolutionary War, George Washington’s army was on the verge of collapse. Congress appointed an inspector general for the army, a former Prussian officer, Baron Von Steuben. He met Washington’s troops at Valley Forge and was shocked at their disorganization and abysmal conditions. He began inspecting, training, and drilling the troops, and the Continental Army left Valley Forge as a more effective fighting force. His efforts were described as indispensable to Washington’s  victory. The U.S. army has had an IG ever since.

However, military IGs are not like civilian IGs, who have greater independence. Civilian IGs were established after the Watergate scandal, in the Inspector General Act of 1978, as part of a series of good government reforms.

I hope readers will gain insight into  the importance of inspectors general as a critical check and balance in our government. I also hope the book is helpful for students of public policy, law, and government, motivating some of them to work in inspector general offices or other public service positions. And I hope that this book encourages citizens and lawmakers to strengthen the unique role of inspectors general in the continual challenge of keeping our government honest and accountable.

*What surprised you the most in the process of writing your book?* 

I was surprised by how much I enjoyed the writing process. Despite being an inspector general for more than fifteen years, through researching and writing this book I learned more about inspectors general that I had not previously known. I also enjoyed revisiting and rereading the reports and investigations that we had conducted. It was gratifying to recall the range the matters that we handled, as well as the impact of our reports. In addition, I appreciated the help in writing, editing, and promoting the book from the University of Virginia Press, its editors, and its staff. It was a delight to work with them. 

*What’s your favorite anecdote from your book?*

An inspector general is not the most popular person in government, in any administration.  IGs must develop a thick skin for criticism. I am certain that as the inspector general, I was not the most popular person in the halls of the Justice Department or in the Pentagon food court.   

One anecdote illustrates the point that an independent inspector general cannot expect to be popular. Shortly after I became the Justice Department inspector general, I was asked by a senator to come to his office to brief him about one of our completed reports. I brought to the briefing my terrific deputy inspector general, Paul Martin.

After I finished the briefing, the senator said to me, “Good briefing, but now let me tell you what I think of IGs.” He pointed his finger at me and declared, “IGs must be independent. You will do things that I won’t like. You will do things other members of Congress won’t like. You will do things the attorney general won’t like. Nobody will like you.”

He kept repeating that and pointing his finger at me. After a while, I think my deputy Paul  had heard enough. He interjected, “Don’t worry about that, senator. Even I don’t like him.” That cracked everyone up and was the end of the meeting.

While the exchange was humorous (in retrospect), the senator was making a crucial point about inspectors general. I knew as an inspector general, I would not be popular, but I hoped that our work would be respected and help improve the agency’s operations.

*What’s next?* 

When I was removed by President Trump in 2020 from my position as the acting Defense Department inspector general, I had to think about the next chapter of my career.  But when one door closes, others open. I am now a nonresident fellow at the Brookings Institution. In addition, I am an adjunct professor at Georgetown Law School and have taught at Stanford Law School on inspectors general and accountability in government. I enjoy teaching these courses and learn as much from my students as they do from me.
