Our heartiest congratulations to Julie Bargmann for being selected as the inaugural winner of the [Cornelia Hahn Oberlander International Landscape Architecture Prize](https://tclf.org/prize) for her vision and persistent in reclaiming “fallow” lands—those damaged during the industrial economy and since. “Julie Bargmann is a true pioneer in her field but also has instructed all of us in what to keep and what to save as we reimagine cities,” says Suzanne Morse Moomaw, director of UVA Press and UVA Architectural School colleague. Bargmann has devoted her teaching and practice to reclaiming and repurposing wastelands in rural and urban areas. Her regenerative approach to design has brought land back to useful purposes building on its natural and built amenities and environs.

The prize, awarded by the Cultural Landscape Foundation, honors the legacy of one of the most important landscape architects of the twentieth century, whose socially responsible and ecologically sensitive planning for public landscapes include the 1970s design of the Robson Square landscape and its adjoining Provincial Law Courts—one of Vancouver’s most famous spaces. Oberlander’s life and work are recounted by Susan Herrington in *[Cornelia Hahn Oberlander: Making the Modern Landscape](https://www.upress.virginia.edu/title/4295),* published by the University of Virginia Press in 2014.
