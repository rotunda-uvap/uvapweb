Today, we are happy to bring you our conversation with Theresa M. Towner, editor of *DIGITIZING FAULKNER: Yoknapatawpha in the Twenty-First Century*

*What inspired you to write this book?* 

My work as Associate Director of Digital Yoknapatawpha (www.faulkner.iath.virginia.edu) inspired me to develop a volume that would bring the study of digital humanities into traditional scholarly conversations.  I wanted to show readers the variety of things we can learn using this new method of studying Faulkner.

*What did you learn and what are you hoping readers will learn from your book?* 

I learned new ways to read, and I learned that my contributing authors had, too.  I hope our readers will learn that there is no one “right” way to understand Faulkner’s fiction.

*What surprised you the most in the process of writing your book?* 

There really weren’t any surprises since I had chosen the contributors, but I was very gratified by the enthusiasm they all brought to the book, even during the revisions I asked them to make.  This book is the most collegial publishing experience I’ve ever had.

*What’s your favorite anecdote from your book?*

When one contributor had to withdraw from writing a chapter, the scholar who agreed to write it used the original author’s title for the essay.  Told you it was a collegial project!

*What’s next?* 

I’m editing all of Faulkner’s short stories for publication in a new volume for the Library of America, which has already published corrected texts of his novels, and I’m writing an essay on the short stories about the Civil War that he published in the *Saturday Evening Post* for a volume on that magazine’s representations of war.
