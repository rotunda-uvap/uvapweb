**About Rotunda:**

In 2002 the University of Virginia Press launched its electronic imprint, [Rotunda](/rotunda), to make digital documentary editions available to scholars, students, and practitioners. Since then, Rotunda's flagship American History Collection has evolved from a resource focused on the American Founding Era to span political and cultural history well into the twentieth century.

The types of content in each documentary series include personal, wartime, and presidential correspondence, diaries, speeches, financial tables, and news clippings.  Most of the AHC publications derive from authoritative letterpress editions, but others are born-digital.

Over the next two years, we will add two new publications based on print editions: [The Papers of Booker T. Washington](/news/booker-t-washington-has-a-new-charlottesville-connection-a-digital-edition-of-his-papers) and The Papers of Frederick Law Olmsted. These two upcoming collections will diversify Rotunda’s current offerings beyond our solid core of canonical documents in political/military history to include a rich source of material in the African-American experience and the development of both rural and urban America between the Civil War and World War I.
