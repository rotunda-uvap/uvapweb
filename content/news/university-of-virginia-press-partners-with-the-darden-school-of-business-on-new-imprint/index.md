University of Virginia Press and the University of Virginia Darden School of Business have announced a publishing partnership to launch UVA Darden Business Publishing, an imprint of the University of Virginia Press. Through the partnership, UVA Press will publish books in print and digital editions under the auspices and imprint of the business school.

UVA Darden Business Publishing will continue as a standalone publisher of case-based classroom content for management education, while expanding operations to publish scholarship on business and economics from scholars at colleges and universities worldwide. The new imprint’s first title will be *Marketing Analytics* by Darden Professor Rajkumar Venkatesan, scheduled to be published in spring 2021.

“This partnership provides an opportunity for faculty at Darden and around the world to have a strong publisher for leading-edge business content and scholarship and, for UVA Press, to have an exciting group of new authors. With Darden’s world-renowned faculty, the imprint promises to reach across the globe,” said Suzanne Morse Moomaw, director of UVA Press.

Books published by the imprint will push the boundaries for corporate leaders, faculty, students and a general reading audience. At this time of extraordinary global change, new analysis and thinking that challenge old scenarios and create pathways for new ones will have enormous impact.

**“**This is an exciting way for Darden to extend its capability beyond the current focus on pedagogical materials that are used in business education. Leveraging the expertise of UVA Press is a natural fit for both parties,” said Maureen Wellen, Darden’s executive director of faculty advancement.

The partnership will be led by Eric Brandt, editor-in-chief of UVA Press, and Stephen Momper, director of Darden Business Publishing.

Today, **Darden Business Publishing** is the second-largest case publisher in the United States and the third-largest in the world. The publishing unit’s case collection contains more than 3,000 cases, technical notes, exercises, books, and simulations used in more than 130 countries around the world.
