Make a GIN RICKEY, the official native cocktail of DC, to join in the festivities! 

2 ounces gin (can substitute bourbon or rye whiskey)

Half a lime squeezed and dropped into the glass

Sparkling mineral water

Combine spirit and lime in a highball glass. Add ice, stir, then add sparkling mineral water to fill to the top.

This cocktail originated at Shoemaker’s bar at 1331 E Street in DC by bartender George A. Williamson in the 1880s, and was named for the Democratic lobbyist (and the bar’s co-owner) Col. Joe Rickey. Rickey was quoted as saying, “Only a few years ago, I was Col. Rickey of Missouri, the friend of senators, judges and statesmen and something of an authority on political matters and political movements…But am I ever spoken of for those reasons? I fear not. No, I am known to fame as the author of the ‘rickey,’ and I have to be satisfied with that. There is one consolation in the fact that there are fashions in drinks. The present popularity of the Scotch highball may possibly lose me my reputation and restore me my former fame. ’Tis a consummation devoutly to be wished for.”
