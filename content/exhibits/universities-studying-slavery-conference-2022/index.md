UVA Press has a noted history of publishing outstanding scholarship on the legacies of slavery and racism in institutional settings. As Stony Brook University president Maurie D. McInnis and UVA professor Louis P. Nelson articulated in their book *Educated in Tyranny*, the central paradox at the heart of the University of Virginia is also that of the nation: What does it mean to have a public university established to preserve democratic rights that is founded and maintained on the stolen labor of others? We are proud to serve as one of the key sites of that inquiry.
