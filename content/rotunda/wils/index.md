Taking office with a Democrat-held House and Senate, Woodrow Wilson embarked on one of the most important chapters in the Progressive movement, approving the Federal Reserve Act, establishing the Fair Trade Commission, and strongly endorsing the Nineteenth Amendment and women’s right to vote. Wilson also presided over America’s involvement in the first World War, after which he helped create the League of Nations (for which he won 1919 Nobel Peace Prize) and envisioned a policy of global democracy that came to be called “Wilsonian.” Rotunda’s digital edition of Wilson’s papers includes the complete contents of the landmark letterpress edition of the papers, with nearly 40,000 documents covering personal correspondence, academic work, and speeches, spread across 69 volumes, including a five-part index.
