A member of the Continental Congress, signer of the Declaration of Independence, surgeon general of the Continental Army, treasurer of the U.S. Mint—as well as an abolitionist and a proponent of wider access to education and the rights of women—Benjamin Rush had perhaps the most varied career of any American founder. His papers offer insights into a diverse range of issues and dramatic moments of the Revolutionary era and early republic.
