One of the leading families of colonial South Carolina and the early republic, the Pinckneys of Charleston were witnesses to—and often active participants in—many of the defining customs and transforming events of the early national South. This digital resource collects, for the first time, the papers of three of the most notable Pinckneys: brothers Charles Cotesworth Pinckney (1746–1825) and Thomas Pinckney (1750–1828) and their cousin Charles Pinckney (1757–1824). They served variously as young officers during the Americana Revolution, governors of the state of South Carolina, delegates to the Constitutional Convention, leading lawyers and businessmen in Charleston, and diplomats to England, France, and Spain.

Eventually comprising over 3,000 documents, this publication is fully searchable and interoperable with the other titles in Rotunda’s American Founding Era collection and includes the complete contents of the previously released [The Papers of Eliza Lucas Pinckney and Harriott Pinckney Horry.](http://rotunda.upress.virginia.edu/PinckneyHorry/)
