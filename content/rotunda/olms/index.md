This ROTUNDA digital collection includes the nine volumes of the print edition and a supplementary volume covering Olmsted’s writings on public spaces, accompanied by extensive illustrations extracted from the print volume. Through a partnership with the National Association of Olmsted Parks (NAOP) and ROTUNDA, the searchable site allows scholars, students, and community members the opportunity to do a new level of research on this venerable designer. Olmsted’s writings as a journalist and a designer give new insights into his projects but also the conditions of late nineteenth century America. He traveled through the southern states as a journalist, imagined how universities might realize design possibilities, and added new considerations to space and health and much more.
