American landscape as a cultivated public space begins with Frederick Law Olmsted. The father of American landscape architecture, however, was also much more. A pioneer in journalism, urban planning, and conservation, Olmsted helped America recognize and cultivate both its rich natural heritage and its urban vitality.

Coinciding with the two-hundred-year anniversary of Olmsted’s birth, this digital archive contains the contents of the nine-volume print edition plus a supplementary volume, including the extensive illustrations, in a single, searchable resource. The digital edition of Frederick Law Olmsted’s papers will prove indispensable to students, scholars, and practitioners of landscape architecture, architecture and design, urban planning, conservation, and anyone interested in the lives of America’s great visionaries.
