Gouverneur Morris played an important role in the American Revolution, made profound contributions to the Constitution (including writing its Preamble), and was the American minister to France during the height of the French Revolution. He began keeping a diary after arriving in France in 1789 and continued until his death in 1816. This Rotunda version of his diaries includes both the new UVA Press edition of his European diaries covering 1794–98 and his New York diaries from 1799 through 1816, and a corrected version of the two-volume 1939 edition of his Paris diaries from 1789–1793.
