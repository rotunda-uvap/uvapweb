The series editors seek to publish new monographs and essay collections, focused broadly on Black history, literature, and culture in multidisciplinary and diasporic perspective.  We are open, simultaneously, to work that captures the various articulations of Black Studies at work in the world of academia and beyond.

As ours is a series named for the famed historian Carter G. Woodson, we especially encourage projects that engage the "pillars" of Woodson's scholarship and research, as well as those that explore the continued implications and inflections of his work for contemporary intellectual questions and scholarly research in Black Studies. Broadly speaking, these pillars include **Religion, Education, Migration, Labor and Economics, Africa and African Diasporas, Politics and Intellectual Production,** and **Family**.

In addition to these topics, foundational to the intellectual history and development of Black Studies, we also solicit manuscripts that chart innovative directions and open new scholarly conversations for the field.
