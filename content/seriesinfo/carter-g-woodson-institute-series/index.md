Named for the famed historian Carter G. Woodson, this series seeks to publish new monographs and essay collections focused broadly on Black history, literature, and culture in multidisciplinary and diasporic perspective. The series editors are open, simultaneously, to work that captures the various articulations of Black Studies at work in the world even beyond academia.
