This series is open to a wide array of scholarship on the ramifications of “soldiering” on the economic, social, cultural, or political lives of Black individuals, families, and communities. The editors seek projects that will highlight the long, and in many cases unending, fight for racial and social justice across time and space in the Black Atlantic.
