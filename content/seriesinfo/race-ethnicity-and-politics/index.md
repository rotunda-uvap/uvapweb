This series explores the implications of the increasingly multiracial, multiethnic, and multicultural composition of American cities and of American society more generally. Books in the series look at intergroup competition and conflict; at ambiguities of increased minority representation resulting from white out-migration and the application of the Voting Rights Act; at daunting urban crises in which race and ethnicity play a central part; and at a range of theoretical issues tied to racial and ethnic diversity.
