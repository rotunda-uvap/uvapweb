The American Spirituality series publishes histories, ethnographies, biographies, and critical editions designed to deepen understanding of the varied ways that Americans have imagined spirituality, past and present. As such, the series advances new critical perspectives on how religious norms, practices, and institutions—including the very labeling of “religion” and “spirituality”—have been thrashed out in American culture.
