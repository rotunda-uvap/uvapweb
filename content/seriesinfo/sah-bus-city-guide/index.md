[Buildings of the United States](https://www.upress.virginia.edu/series/buildings-united-states)Â is a series of books on American architecture compiled and written on a state-by-state basis, with separate guides for specific cities. The primary objective of the series is to identify and celebrate the rich cultural, economic, and geographical diversity of the United States as it is reflected in the architecture of each state. The series has been commissioned by the Society of Architectural Historians, an organization dedicated to the study, interpretation, and preservation of the built environment throughout the world.
