Questioning the body as the historical subject of experiences “peculiar” to it, this series examines the myriad forms of the body—healthy, diseased, athletic, crippled, alluring, pious—across all disciplines, periods, and geographic contexts. The series embraces a range of historical, literary, and philosophical methodologies and theories around the idea of “the body.”
