Building on the extraordinary scholarly reputation and archival resources of the University of Virginia, this series seeks to publish the most innovative scholarship on the cultural, intellectual, and social life of Tibetan Buddhism.

This series will investigate both the stability of Tibetan religious culture from its historical beginnings in the sixth century through the modern era, as well as how the religious tradition has changed in reaction to historical relaties, technological transformation, and social unrest. To facilitate an interdisciplinary approach, the Traditions and Transformations in Tibetan Buddhism series acquires projects on four interconnected themes:

**Ritual Traditions and Textual Transformations**: researching how Buddhist contemplative, ritual, and textual traditions entered Tibet and went through processes of remarkable transformation

**Tibet in its Historical Milieu:** researching the historical interactions of Tibetan Buddhist practices and beliefs with the world and peoples around Tibet

**Tibet and the Modern World:** investigating the contemporary renaissance of Tibetan religous practice and identity in the People’s Republic of China and India

**Tibetan Buddhism in Diaspora**: examining how Tibetan Buddhist practices are being transformed as Tibetan communities spread throughout India, Europe, and America

*Series Editors: David Germano & Michael Sheehy*
