This series is devoted to publishing innovative work on the American South. Its goal is to reach across conventional boundaries of discipline, geography, and chronology to foster fresh perspectives on the region. The series welcomes historians, literary scholars, anthropologists, geographers, photographers, folklorists, journalists, and others whose work focuses on the southeastern United States during any period of the past or present. The Press encourages interdisciplinary and comparative studies as well as those that examine the place of the region in national or international contexts.
