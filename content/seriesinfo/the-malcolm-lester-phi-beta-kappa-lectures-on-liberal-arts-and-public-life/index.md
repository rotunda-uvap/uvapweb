The Malcolm Lester Lectures are held annually as part of Mercer University’s Phi Beta Kappa induction ceremony. For each series, an important figure in American higher education delivers three lectures on the value of a liberal arts education. Named for its benefactor, a graduate of both Mercer University and the University of Virginia, this series fulfills Dr. Malcolm Lester’s vision for a series of lectures that supports the mission of the Phi Beta Kappa Society and that reaches a broad audience to influence the discourse about liberal arts in the United States.
