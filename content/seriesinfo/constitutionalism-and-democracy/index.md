This series publishes outstanding titles on constitutional politics, legal culture, and the historical relationship between democratic government and the social and economic forces that shape it. The editors seek manuscripts on constitutional development and legal history as well as both qualitative and quantitative analyses of judicial politics. At the same time, they aim to encompass a broader set of topics, including comparative law and courts, new institutionalism, and the theory of democratic principles and legal institutions.
