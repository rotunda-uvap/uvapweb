Until the demise of apartheid, the historiography of southern Africa was dominated by opposing schools with differing analyses of it. This series reflects facets of southern African history that were neglected by these contending historical schools. Indeed, changing power relations in the region have broadened the scope of historical inquiry. Emerging topics include the history of women, religion, ideas, popular culture, the professions, manners, childhood, disease, mental illness, death and dying, technology, and the environment.
