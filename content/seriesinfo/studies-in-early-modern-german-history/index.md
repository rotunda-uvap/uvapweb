This series emphasizes new and fresh approaches to German history during the early modern Period: ca. 1400-1800. Including works translated from German and original works in English, the series introduces readers to some of the most innovative and creative books on subjects ranging from the history of madness and witchcraft, to the culture of drinking, the most powerful German merchant family of Renaissance times, and early German reactions to the discovery of America. These are not the conventional topics taught in schools but examples of the vitality and variety offered by historians of the Holy Roman Empire (the German language area).
