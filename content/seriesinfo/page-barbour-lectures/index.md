Founded in 1907, the Page-Barbour Lectures and an endowed series held annually at the University of Virginia. The lectures, which may be in any field in the arts and sciences, are to present “some fresh aspect or aspects of the department of thought” in which the lecturer is a specialist and are to possess such unity as to be published in book form by the University.
