Advancing innovative scholarship on the American presidency, this series seeks to ask timeless and novel questions about theÂ institution and its role in a constitutional democracy, to re-invigorate its study across disciplines, and to publish its findings through novel vehicles and formats. Through a capacious approach to the field, it seeks to highlight the relevance of historical developments to current affairs and to explore the evolution of the office over time.
