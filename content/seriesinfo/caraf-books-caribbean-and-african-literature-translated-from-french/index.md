The CARAF Books series is designed to make available to a public of English-speaking readers the works of contemporary francophone writers in the Caribbean and Africa that have been heretofore unavailable in English. For students, scholars, and general readers, CARAF offers selected novels, short stories, plays, poetry, and essays that have attracted attention across national boundaries, offering valuable insights into a highly varied group of complex and evolving cultures.
