I acquire books in literature, culture, and religious studies. In literature and culture, I have a special focus on American literature, African American studies, Caribbean literature, and Victorian culture. In religious studies, I am particularly interested in social scientific studies of religious experience, whether American or Asian. I also oversee the CARAF translation series of books by renowned francophone Caribbean and African authors.</p><p>I earned my A.B. from Wabash College, an A.M.R.S. from the University of Chicago Divinity School, and a Ph.D. from Columbia University. I have taught humanities courses at five different universities. Half of my publishing career has been spent working for major trade houses such as HarperCollins, Macmillan, and Basic Books, and the other half at Columbia, Yale, and Stanford university presses.
