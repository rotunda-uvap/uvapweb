I acquire books in business and economics. I am particularly interested in books that translate thought-leading ideas into practice. The ideal book project will inspire business leaders by looking at consequential problems and issues and suggesting practical, innovative solutions.

I earned my MBA from the University of South Dakota and my bachelor’s degree from Yankton College. I started my career teaching accounting at Dakota Wesleyan University, a liberal arts college in South Dakota. Three years later, I started in the book publishing industry with South-Western Publishing Company, part of the Thomson Corporation. During my 22 years with Thomson, I held positions in sales, marketing, and editorial. In 2006, I joined Darden Business Publishing, where I continue to oversee the publication of management-education content. In January 2021, in collaboration with the University of Virginia Press, we launched the Darden book imprint.
