Susan worked at The Papers of Thomas Jefferson: Retirement Series for seventeen years before joining the UVA Press in 2024. With a B.S. in landscape architecture and M.S. in software engineering from West Virginia University, and M.F.A. in historic preservation from the Savannah College of Art and Design, she is comfortable working in very different fields and adapting to the needs of each. As the Editorial and Technical Specialist for the Rotunda Digital Imprint, with a specific focus on the American History Collection, she is committed to making sure the digital edition of each project maintains the high standards set by the editors while looking for new ways to make the information more accessible to a digital audience.
