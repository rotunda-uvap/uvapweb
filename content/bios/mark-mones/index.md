I acquire books covering a range of subjects, from architecture/architectural history to urban design (including our Midcentury series), as well as projects surveying history, art, folklore, nature and the environment, music, and other areas of general interest throughout Virginia and the region for our new imprint, Rivanna Books. I received a BA in sociology and anthropology from Gettysburg College and an MA in anthropology from the University of Virginia, and my list reflects admittedly wide-ranging and eclectic interests. I started my career in scholarly reference at Oxford University Press, where I was a principal editor for the Buildings of the United States, a collaborative venture with the Society of Architectural Historians that has continued to this day, with the series and *SAH Archipedia*, the online encyclopedia of American architecture, now a principal part of UVA Pressâ€™s publishing program.
