I acquire books in history and politics, with a special focus on colonial, revolutionary, and nineteenth-century American history and series centered on the American presidency and on the history and future of democracy. I also oversee a series on Early Modern German history, and my portfolio includes academic and trade books on the history and culture of Virginia. As a transnational historian by training, I am excited about manuscripts that put historical developments in broad temporal and geographic contexts.

I graduated with a B.A. in History from Shepherd College in 2004 and earned my Ph.D. in History from the University of Wisconsin-Madison in 2011. In 2005, I got my start in academic publishing by working on the George L. Mosse Series in the History of European Culture, Sexuality, and Ideas at the University of Wisconsin Press. For a decade, I worked in the books program of the Omohundro Institute of Early American History and Culture at William & Mary (whose titles are published by the University of North Carolina Press) before joining UVA Press in 2019.
