I acquire books in history and the social sciences, with a special focus on American history and politics across five centuries.</p><p> I also oversee series on Early Modern German and on Southern African history and my portfolio includes academic and trade books on the history and culture of Virginia. As a transnational historian by training, I am excited about manuscripts that put historical developments in broad temporal and geographic contexts and particularly welcome examinations of Americansâ€™ experiences and legacies abroad.
