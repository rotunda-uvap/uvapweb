I acquire books on the early modern and Enlightenment periods, the history of science, the environmental humanities, and contemporary culture. My list is unified by a focus on interdisciplinary projects as well as those that address issues of race, ethnicity, gender, sexuality, and disability to advance our understanding of both human diversity and the complex history of marginalization.Â  

I hold a B.A. in English literature from Vanderbilt University and an M.F.A. in creative writing (poetry) from the University of Virginia. Prior to joining UVA Press in 2004, I worked for InteLex Corporation, a pioneer in humanities electronic publishing.
