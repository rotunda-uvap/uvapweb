I acquire for the Press’s humanities list, with a particular focus on literary and cultural studies of the eighteenth-, twentieth-, and twenty-first centuries as well as environmental studies. I administer Virginia’s Walker Cowen Memorial Prize in eighteenth-century studies and serve as in-house editor for several series. With a special interest in interdisciplinary work, I invite projects that engage ethics; dis/ability studies; gender and sexuality studies; critical race theory; the history of science and medicine; ecocriticism; media studies; politics; and legal and economic history.</p><p>I hold a B.A. in English literature from Vanderbilt University and an M.F.A. in creative writing (poetry) from the University of Virginia. Prior to joining UVA Press in 2004, I worked for InteLex Corporation, a pioneer in humanities electronic publishing.
