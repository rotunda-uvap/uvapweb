David has been with UVAP's Electronic imprint (Rotunda) since 2002, first as managing editor, then as editorial and technical manager, and finally as manager. Although his academic training was in linguistics and literature (Ph.D. University of California, San Diego, 1984), he developed interest and expertise in Unix/Linux computer systems, programming, and humanities computing during graduate school that he has extended while with Rotunda. Prior to joining Rotunda he was a project editor in the Press's Manuscript Editorial department for three years. Before coming to UVA he had worked as a freelance editor, a journal editor at the University of Arizona, and a member of the English Department at the University of Rochester.
