I acquire books on Africa and the African Diaspora. My list seeks texts that explore African and Afro-diasporic cultural practices and quotidian life in the contemporary period by connecting them to historical, economic, and political causes. Books on racialization in Africa and its Diaspora, Black colonial and postcolonial life, Black/Afro-feminisms and womanisms, Black transnationalism and international connections, Black queer life and theory, Afro-Caribbean and Afro-Latin American politics and identities, Black disability studies, and contemporary Black arts and cultures in the U.S. South are of particular interest.

I hold a B.A. in Political Science and Latina/o Studies from Northwestern University and an M.A./Ph.D. in African and African Diaspora Studies from the University of Texas at Austin.
