Cecilia learned the craft of book design in her hometown of Buenos Aires, Argentina where she graduated with a degree in graphic design from the University of Palermo. Ceci believes book design is a discourse where white space, letters and images play a part on each cover and each page to tell a story. She taught typography at the University of Buenos Aires and ran an independent book design studio before moving to Charlottesville. She joined the UVA Press in 2016.
