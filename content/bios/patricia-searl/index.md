I have been working with the Rotunda Digital Imprint since 2013, specializing in web development and XML technologies. In addition to prepping materials coming into the American History Collection, I am the developer for [SAH Archipedia](https://sah-archipedia.org) and the UVA Press website. I look forward to helping Rotunda evolve in the future using modern web technologies and collaborating with other organizations in and outside the University to create supplementary resources and functionality to improve the use of Rotunda digital resources in classrooms. 

I have an M.A. in Digital Humanities from Kings College London, and a B.A. in English Literature from the University of Virginia. In addition, I have taken graduate courses to fit the Virginia teaching curriculum and have had several years of work experience for the newspaper industry in marketing, web and graphic design.
