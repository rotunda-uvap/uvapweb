I have been working with the Rotunda Digital Imprint since 2013, after completing a MA in Digital Humanities from Kings College London, where I specialized in text encoding, linked data, and digital publishing. In addition to prepping materials coming into the American History Collection, I am the developer for [SAH Archipedia](https://sah-archipedia.org) and this UVA Press website. I look forward to helping Rotunda evolve in the future using modern web technologies and collaborating with other organizations in and outside the University to create supplementary resources and functionality to improve the use of digital resources in classrooms.

Prior to joining the Press, I worked in the cultural heritage sector (Historic Jamestowne) and for the Newspaper industry in various capacities, but largely advertising, web and graphic design. I hold BA in Literature from the University of Virginia, with additional graduate work in education.
