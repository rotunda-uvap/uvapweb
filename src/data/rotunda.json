As chief author of the Constitution, he provided a framework through which the nation could function after independence.

As one of the great diplomats of the era, Adams spent eight years in Europe, called upon by his young country to negotiate treaties with France, the Netherlands, Great Britain, Prussia, and the Barbary States.<\/p><p>Upon his return to America he served as vice president under George Washington and, eventually, second president of the United States. An embattled nonpartisan in an age of emerging party alliance, his popularity and influence fluctuated dramatically with the controversy over the XYZ Affair, Quasi-War with France, the Alien and Sedition Acts, and conflicts with his own cabinet. During this period in the Executive branch, he saw the movement of the federal government from New York to Philadelphia to the District of Columbia. The vice presidential and presidential years or executive period of Adams&rsquo;s public career will be dealt with in the future as new print volumes are added to the digital edition shortly after their publication.<\/p><p>Adams&rsquo;s importance lay not only in his insistence on freedom for America, but in his ability to show the emerging republic what this freedom meant.

        "MainDescription":{"html":"<p>The careers of few figures in American history have encompassed as much as did John Jay&rsquo;s. His accomplishments span pre- and post-Revolutionary history and extend into all three branches of government. Best known as the first chief justice of the Supreme Court, Jay entered public service as a representative in the Continental Congress, where this Anglican member of the New York elite gradually became an ardent supporter of independence. Jay played a central role in the 1783 peace treaty with Great Britain, ending the American Revolution. Dissatisfied with the Articles of Confederation, Jay argued for the ratification of the new Constitution in pseudonymously authored articles in the Federalist Papers. When President Washington appointed Jay chief justice, the Supreme Court was a blank slate, and his papers provide a fascinating look at the creation of court procedure, much of which survives to this day. Jay&rsquo;s most important act during his years as chief justice was not judicial but diplomatic--namely his negotiating the ultimately controversial 1794 Jay Treaty with Great Britain. After leaving the court, Jay continued to exercise his influence, serving two terms as governor of New York and advocating on a number of issues, including the abolition of slavery.<\/p><p>Building on and revising the pioneering scholarship begun by Richard B. Morris in the 1950s, the digital edition of Jay&rsquo;s papers will include all seven volumes planned for the complete print edition. This XML-based archive is fully annotated and searchable, and as part of Rotunda&rsquo;s American Founding Era collection it is interoperable with digital editions covering the first four presidents, as well as with the papers of Alexander Hamilton and John Marshall and the <i>Documentary History of the Ratification of the Constitution.<\/i><\/p>"},

Grant never intended to make a career in the military, much less go into politics, but he ended up commanding the U.S. forces in perhaps the most important war America ever fought and then serving as its eighteenth president during a period of profound change.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<br>Following a brief and frustrating period of civilian life after he fought in the Mexican American War (a war he personally did not approve of), Grant reentered military life at the outbreak of the Civil War. While Abraham Lincoln cycled through a succession of generals, none of whom could defeat the Confederate forces, Grant scored major strategic victories at Shiloh and Vicksburg and in the Chattanooga Campaign. He eventually won the job of Commanding General of the Union Army, and within roughly a year accepted Robert E. Lee’s surrender at Appomattox.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<br>Grant’s willingness—it could never be called eagerness--to take on the presidency was inspired by his conviction that what had been so hard won in the war could not be wasted by “mere trading politicians.” His two terms as president included scandal, and some of Grant’s initiatives were more well-intentioned than successful, but he addressed a remarkable number of issues, ranging from the reconstruction of the South--which he sought to execute without a sense of Northern occupation--and the complex political divide that still existed to terrible economic upheaval, peaking with the Panic of 1873. However flawed they may have been, actions such as his Civil Rights Act of 1875 and Indian Peace Policy strike the modern observer as farsighted in their prioritizing of human rights and their empathy with both African Americans and native peoples.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<br>Grant’s last great act was the intensely focused composition of his memoirs, which became the best seller they were calculated to be and revealed Grant as one of the most eloquent Americans to pick up a pen.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<br>This digital edition is based on one of the great documentary editions in American scholarship, the original letterpress volumes of Grant’s papers, edited by John Y. Simon. This edition, wrote the New York Times, 'helped cement Grant’s place as a literary memoirist and not just a war diarist . . . [and] changed the nature of documentary editing.' The Rotunda edition contains the content of the original thirty-one print volumes edited by Simon, including all editorial annotations, introductory essays, and appendices, as well as an additional volume of supplementary documents completed by John F.

His influence on our nation, however, has been consistent and profound. We remember him above all as the nation&rsquo;s first great fiscal voice, but his accomplishments extend into the arenas of diplomacy, law, warfare, and political strategy. Though never a president himself, he was a crucial advisor in Washington&rsquo;s administration&mdash;where he served as the nation&rsquo;s first secretary of the Treasury&mdash;and greatly influenced, not always benevolently, the elections of both Adams and Jefferson. Despite his reluctance to see America split into factions, Hamilton&rsquo;s Federalists&mdash;who called for a strong central government and a national bank&mdash;signaled the emergence of political parties in the young nation.<\/p><p>Hamilton remains one of the key figures in American legal history. A lawyer in his private life, he was the only person from New York to sign the Constitution and fought tirelessly for its ratification. Hamilton was also the primary author of the Federalist Papers, to this day perhaps the most consulted commentary on the Constitution both in the academy and in our courts.<\/p><p>Hamilton&rsquo;s writings take us from the front lines of the Revolutionary War to the Congress of the Confederation to the early days of Manhattan Island. The cast comprises the most notable personages of the era, including the early presidents, the Marquis de Lafayette, John Jay, and archrival Aaron Burr, with whom he had his fatal duel.<\/p><p>This digital edition contains all 27 volumes of the print edition of the Papers&mdash;all the writings by and to Hamilton known to exist, some 19,000 documents&mdash;including all editorial annotations. Additional content that, in the print edition, was collected in appendices appears here in its proper chronological place; there is also a cumulative index, and all cross-references are linked. This XML-based publication provides the maximum searching ability and is interoperable with other titles in the American Founding Era Collection, so users may search across multiple collections of documents, including the papers of the first four presidents.<\/p>"},

But Johnson’s career is notable for more than his impeachment, with much to tell us about Civil War–era politics and the complexity of Reconstruction, through a trajectory that is one of the most compelling, and strange, in presidential history.<\/p><p>Johnson was born into poverty but rose quickly in Tennessee politics, serving as governor before moving on to the US House of Representatives and then the Senate. Despite being a slave owner, Johnson was the only senator of a Confederate state not to resign when his home state seceded. Johnson walked a fine political line between sectional interests, and while his Southern Unionist position inspired Lincoln to choose him as his running mate in 1864, Johnson’s sympathies for the South would generate enormous controversy when he succeeded Lincoln as president. The eventual impeachment process—Johnson escaped dismissal from office by a single vote—provides a fascinating look at a critical era in American history as Congress and Johnson’s own cabinet conspired to make him the most embattled of presidents.<\/p><p>This digital edition of Johnson’s papers—which also covers notable events in a career that spanned decades and included the Homestead Act and the Alaska Purchase—collects the complete contents of the print edition’s sixteen volumes.

Maryland, which established implied powers and limited the power of the states to impede constitutionally valid actions taken by the federal government. As a senator, he opposed nullification by southern states, as he expressed in his legendary “Reply to Hayne” speech, and provided critical support for the Compromise of 1850. As secretary of state in 1842—the first of three separate tenures in that position, under three different presidents—Webster established the U.S.-Canada border that exists to this day. Webster served in Congress for two states (New Hampshire and Massachusetts), and, in the waning days of his Whig Party, ran for president three times. There are few roles in government he did not play, few defining issues of the mid-nineteenth century of which he did not find himself at the center.<\/p><p>Rotunda’s digital edition of The Papers of Daniel Webster includes the complete contents of the classic fourteen-volume print edition and adds to this the power to search its documents and those of other titles in the American History platform.
